## Steps to build a job bidding web app
The job owner will have a fixed budget, which is disclosed in this 
case. The bid by the users is not visible to other users, but to the
owner. 

Which means there will be two types of users. One is owner and the 
other is worker. 

The owner can open multiple jobs, so the foreignkey of the owner 
will be linked with the jobs he creates

The user can bid for multiple jobs, with a value. So Bid must be a 
seperate table, I think. It will contain the user, job and the bid 
value. 

1- User will log-in to website with email and password

2- website will contain the jobs listed. 
  2a - Job title, description, author, required_connects
  2b - Required data has been collected from Upwork
  2c - Create a model that contains the above data. 

3- Each job can be reviewed and then bid can accepted. 
  3a - To bid the user must be logged in and have connects available
  3b - The bid along with the user will be visible to the job author 
  
  3c - The bid needs to be a seperate table.  

4- The job for which the user has bid will be visible in his dash board

5- Need to get the front-end fixed. 
  5a - Website title will be Bidwork
  5b -
