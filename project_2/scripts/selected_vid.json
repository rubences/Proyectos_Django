LeBron led all scorers with 29 but it was Kyle Kuzma who knocked down the game-winning shot with less than half a second to go. Kuzma finished with 25 and after the game, LeBron said that in order to win a title, Kuzma needs to be their 3rd-best player, or 2nd-best player if he or Anthony Davis is having an off night.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!\u2705 Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry\/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http:\/\/www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date\/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https:\/\/youtu.be\/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

And thanks to his expected brilliance, Messi's side advanced to the quarterfinals. A trio of first-half goals gave the La Liga side a 3-1 win over their opponent, providing a 4-2 aggregate win that saw Barcelona through to the final eight.Lionel Messi, who had a lot on the line entering, scored a fantastic goal in the first half to help build an early 3-1 halftime advantage against their Serie A opposition. Luis Suarez and Clement Lenglet also contributed to the lead with goals of their own, while all Napoli was able to respond with was a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne. The halftime score held for the final 45, ensuring Barcelona's date with Bayern Munich on Friday.Stream every UEFA Champions League match live on CBS All Access: https:\/\/www.cbs.com\/shows\/uefa-champions-league\/Subscribe to UCL on CBS Sports: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/UCLonCBSSports#UCL #Barcelona #Napoli #ChampionsLeague #Messi #LionelMessi #Soccer #EuropeanSoccer"},{"video_id":"bpmGuPhGE0Y","title":"Machine Gun Kelly ft. blackbear - my ex's best friend (Official Lyric Video)","categoryId":10,"thumbnail_link":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bpmGuPhGE0Y\/default.jpg","description":"Machine Gun Kelly ft.

But that didn't stop them from putting on a show.Bayern Munich are through to the Champions League quarterfinals after thumping Chelsea on Saturday. Bayern Munich won the second leg, 4-1, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice. The Bundesliga winners came into the second leg with a 3-0 advantage, so they ended up with a 7-1 aggregate edge over their Premier League opponent.The German side was able to capitalize on their first leg momentum early as Lewandowski, the competition's leading score, earned a penalty kick in the 10th minute and converted the attempt. Bayern added goals throughout with Ivan Perisic scoring in the 24th minute, and Corentin Tolisso adding to the scoreline fresh off the bench during the 76th minute. Lewandowski headed home the 13th goal of his Champions League campaign in the 84th minute.

Starring Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield.  Only in theaters 2021.  \u201cYou can murder a revolutionary, but you can\u2019t murder a revolution.https:\/\/twitter.com\/wbpictureshttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wbpictures https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WarnerBrosPictures\/Chairman Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he was assassinated by the FBI, who coerced a petty criminal named William O\u2019Neal to help them silence him and the Black Panther Party.  But they could not kill Fred Hampton\u2019s legacy and, 50 years later, his words still echo\u2026louder than ever. I am a revolutionary!         In 1968, a young, charismatic activist named Fred Hampton became Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who were fighting for freedom, the power to determine the destiny of the Black community, and an end to police brutality and the slaughter of Black people.Chairman Fred was inspiring a generation to rise up and not back down to oppression, which put him directly in the line of fire of the government, the FBI and the Chicago Police.  But to destroy the revolution, they had to do it from both the outside\u2026and the inside.  Facing prison, William O\u2019Neal is offered a deal by the FBI: if he will infiltrate the Black Panthers and provide intel on Hampton, he will walk free.  O\u2019Neal takes the deal.         Now a comrade in arms in the Black Panther Party, O\u2019Neal lives in fear that his treachery will be discovered even as he rises in the ranks.  But as Hampton\u2019s fiery message draws him in, O\u2019Neal cannot escape the deadly trajectory of his ultimate betrayal.         Though his life was cut short, Fred Hampton\u2019s impact has continued to reverberate.  The government saw the Black Panthers as a militant threat to the status quo and sold that lie to a frightened public in a time of growing civil unrest.  But the perception of the Panthers was not reality.  In inner cities across America, they were providing free breakfasts for children, legal services, medical clinics and research into sickle cell anemia, and political education.  And it was Chairman Fred in Chicago, who, recognizing the power of multicultural unity for a common cause, created the Rainbow Coalition\u2014joining forces with other oppressed peoples in the city to fight for equality and political empowerment.\u201cJudas and the Black Messiah\u201d stars Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya (\u201cGet Out,\u201d \u201cWidows,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther\u201d) as Fred Hampton and LaKeith Stanfield (\u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cThe Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web\u201d) as William O\u2019Neal.  The film also stars Jesse Plemons (\u201cVice,\u201d \u201cGame Night,\u201d \u201cThe Post\u201d), Dominique Fishback (\u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d \u201cThe Deuce\u201d), Ashton Sanders (\u201cThe Equalizer 2,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d) and Martin Sheen (\u201cThe Departed,\u201d TV\u2019s \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d TV\u2019s \u201cGrace & Frankie\u201d).\u201cJudas and the Black Messiah\u201d is directed by Shaka King, marking his studio feature film directorial debut.  The project originated with King and his writing partner, Will Berson, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Kenny Lucas & Keith Lucas, who co-wrote the story with Berson & King.  King, who has a long relationship with filmmaker Ryan Coogler (\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cCreed,\u201d \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d), pitched the film to Coogler and Charles D. King (\u201cJust Mercy,\u201d \u201cFences\u201d), who are producing the film.  The executive producers are Sev Ohanian, Zinzi Coogler, Kim Roth, Poppy Hanks, Ravi Mehta, Jeff Skoll, Anikah McLaren, Aaron L. Gilbert, Jason Cloth, Ted Gidlow, and Niija Kuykendall.The ensemble cast also includes Algee Smith (\u201cThe Hate U Give,\u201d \u201cDetroit\u201d), Darrell Britt-Gibson (\u201cJust Mercy,\u201d \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d), Dominique Thorne (\u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d), Amari Cheatom (\u201cRoman J. Israel, Esq.,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d), Caleb Eberhardt (\u201cThe Post\u201d), and Lil Rel Howery (\u201cGet Out\u201d).The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Sean Bobbitt (\u201c12 Years a Slave,\u201d \u201cWidows\u201d), production designer Sam Lisenco (\u201cShades of Blue\u201d), editor Kristan Sprague (\u201cRandom Acts of Flyness\u201d) and costume designer Charlese Antoinette Jones (\u201cRaising Dion\u201d).The film is a Warner Bros.

Thanks for watching during all of this, it means a lot to all of us. That said, we need to make a few changes with everything going on in the world. James and Mike Monday is on hiatus until February. Rental Reviews is cancelled, but the RR guys (Justin, Kieran, Tony) will be working behind the scenes and will guest-host some upcoming videos. There will be more random videos (like music videos and scripted reviews), plus monthly AVGN and YKWBS. The new release schedule is every Tuesday and Friday at Noon EST. Conventions and any films we were planning are getting pushed back, but my book should make a lot of headway this year. The new AVGN video game will come out this fall sometime on all systems. \ud83c\udfae Add AVGN 1+2 Deluxe to your Steam Wishlist: https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1162960\/Angry_Video_Game_Nerd_I__II_Deluxe\/Follow us on Twitter:James - https:\/\/twitter.com\/cinemassacreMike Matei - https:\/\/twitter.com\/Mike_MateiRyan - https:\/\/twitter.com\/schottrJusty - https:\/\/twitter.com\/JustySilvermanKieran - https:\/\/twitter.com\/KieeeeernTony - https:\/\/twitter.com\/HacktheMoviesCinemassacre Shirts, DVDs, and Blu-rays: https:\/\/store.screenwavemedia.com\/collections\/cinemassacreMerch on Amazon.com: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2ORk1s8Teespring exclusive shirts: https:\/\/teespring.com\/stores\/cinemassacreClick to Subscribe: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=JamesNintendoNerdFollow#Cinemassacre #JamesRolfe #Update"},{"video_id":"Ea04DriyYb4","title":"Video shows Beirut blast as bride poses on her wedding day","categoryId":25,"thumbnail_link":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ea04DriyYb4\/default.jpg","description":"Video captured the terrifying moment when a bride, who was posing for photos on her wedding day, was interrupted by the massive explosion in Beirut that killed at least 135 people on Tuesday.The video shows the bride standing outside her wedding venue posing in a full-length gown.FULL STORY: https:\/\/abc7ne.ws\/3a3FCrlWelcome to the official YouTube channel for ABC7 Bay Area!

So after finding the 'perfect' (his words, not ours) '71 Caprice, it was only a matter of time before he brought it to the Donut Garage as our newest project car. The goal? 1000hp. Good paint.
